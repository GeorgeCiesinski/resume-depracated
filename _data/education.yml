    During my time at Humber College, I acquired many new skills which prepared me for the workforce. My studies focused both on the design and building of automation lines, including different types of programming languages. My classes prepared me for:
    - Programming various kinds of PLCs and Articulated Robots
    - Networking PLCs
    - Developing software to integrate with PLCs using HMI and C#
