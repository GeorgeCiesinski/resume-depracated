    This is an app I created as a free open-source tool for a tech-support workplace. This app allows users to save large amounts of email-templates, signatures, and textblocks and recall these later by typing a shortcut in any text input field. Text-Script was designed to increase efficiency in a work place which heavily relies on sending templates to customers, such as in the Tech Support industry, but can be used for other purposes such as programming. I created Text-Script with <mark>Pynput</mark>, <mark>ConfigParser</mark>, and <mark>Logging</mark>, and I am actively maintaining it with regular releases to add new features and bug fixes.

    This project is the result of a collaboration between myself and two other programmers. We utilized the Reddit API <mark>PRAW</mark> along with a few helpful libraries including <mark>Multiprocessing</mark> and the <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> database to build this bot. Reddit-Rising-Posts finds posts which have reached the Rising status on Reddit and schedules them for data collection. Following this, it creates numerous threads which make API calls to collect data on the post throughout its lifetime until it reaches and finally leaves the Front Page. This data is stored in a postgresql database so we can later retrieve it and analyze the data. This project is actively being developed.

    I used this project as an opportunity to learn <mark>OpenCV</mark>, <mark>Tkinter</mark>, and <mark>Pillow</mark>. I also used <mark>Numpy</mark> to interpret the image matrix. Image-Filters is an image editing app that allows the user to alter the brightness and contrast of the image, change between color and grayscale, and apply different instagram style filters to the image before saving it. This app can open and save images in OpenCV compatible image formats.
