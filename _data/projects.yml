    This project was a step up from my last project. I used this as an opportunity to learn <mark>OpenCV</mark>, <mark>Tkinter</mark>, and <mark>Pillow</mark>. I also used <mark>Numpy</mark> to interpret the image matrix. Image-Filters is an image editing app that allows the user to alter the brightness and contrast of the image, change between color and grayscale, and apply different instagram style filters to the image before saving it. This app can open and save images in OpenCV compatible image formats.

    Basic Calculator is as the name implies, a calculator that performs basic arithmetic. I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Kivy</mark>. I learned many skills with this project, and developed an appreciation for Kivy as an NUI framework.
